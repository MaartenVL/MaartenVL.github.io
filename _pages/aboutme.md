I'm a geographer working a VITO on a broad range of water processes. After obtaining my PhD on soil erosion modelling and crop yield predictions I worked as a data scientist at Locus, where I gained most of my IT/techy skills.

I'd like to use this blog to showcase some of my hobby coding projects and deeper thoughts on things happening around us. This is more or less an extension of my twitter account!
